# Stock-Analysis
## Project Overview
Louise is an up and coming playwright with a new play named "Fever". Louise is looking for a way to fund this play by starting a crowd funding campaign.
She has an estimated budget in mind, but she is hesitant about jumping both feet first into the sea of crowd funding without informed knowledge of how successful, or not, past crowd funding campaigns have been, particularly for plays.
The purpose of this kickstarter project is to help set Louise up for success by analysing historical excel data for past campaigns, to find if there are any specific factors that make a crowd funding campaign successful.
