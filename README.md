# Stock-Analysis
## Project Overview
Steve is a recent graduate of Finance. His parents are passionate about alternative energy future prospect and want to invest in a green energy stock, specificaly in a company called DAQO New Energy Corporation. Steve's parents have not done much research about the potential growth of this company's stock and have decided to invest all of their money in the company. This project is to provide Steve with information that can help his parents invest wisely and diversify their portfolio by analysing past performance of a handful of other green energy stocks in addition to DAQO's. This analysis is done on excel performance data  for a handful of green energy stocks in 2017 and 2018 using VBA.
## Results

### In 2017

    - SEDG (184% gain)
    - ENPH (129% gain)

### In 2018
* Only two stocks had value gains (ENPH: 82% gain and, RUN: 84% gain)
* DQ, Steve's parents choice of stock recorded a loss of 62% in value
* ENPH is the only stock that continued its gains in 2018, though less than 2017 gains
### Conclusions
* Based on the years of data provided, the best stock to invest in is ENPH, with gains in both years
* For portfolio diversification, DQ, FSLR, SEDG are also good to invest in, simply because of ther positive overall gains accross both years
  - NOTE: For more conclusive analysis result, I will suggest more years of data to see performance over long period
